    /*road wiggle effect: the effect occurs at the same time in the left and right sides of the road. it occurs, at minimum speed, every 5 seconds. at max speed, every 0.3 seconds. the effect starts at the vanishing point where the two sides of the road meet, and propagates towards the bottom of the screen. 
normal side of road left (37, 154, 153) (38, 152, 151) (39, 150, 149) (40, 148, 147), (41, 146, 145), (42, 144, 143), (43, 142, 141)
'bump-in wiggle effect' begins (44, 140), (45, 139), (46, 138), at (47, 138), there is no road pixel. it is just the background color. (48, 137), (49, 136), (50, 135, 134), (51, 133, 132), (52, 131, 130), (53, 129, 128), (54, 127, 126), (55, 125, 124), (56, 123, 122), (57, 121, 120, 119), (56, 118, 117, 116, 115). 
normal side of road left continues (57, 114, 113), (58, 112, 111), etc.
the effect is mirrored by the right road edge.*/

// Tuned player speed to match original game
// takes about 14 seconds to fully accelerate from min speed to max speed
// there appear to be 4 gears with timings as follows:
// 1. 4 seconds
// 2. 2.5 seconds
// 3. 3.25 seconds
// 4. 1.5 seconds
// at max speed, enemy cars take around 0.4 seconds to travel from the
// spawn point at the top to the bottom of the screen
// at min speed, enemy cars take around 0.5 seconds to
// travel from the spawn point at the top to the bottom of the screen
// to the vanishing point at the top

// OG enduro car spawning measurements:
// at min speed:
// night: 64 cars passed the player in 49 seconds
// day start: 32 cars per 38 seconds
// snow 
// grass after snow until night: 29 cars per 37 seconds
// after night but before new day: 13 cars per 8 seconds
