// Solved issue with all of this block - some bad values for env->speed
// were occurring. Fixed, which fixed all of these issues as well.
// Separated rendering and environment logic; player car speed
// seems to somehow be locked to enemy car speed. That is, there is
// no difference in the speeds, so player cannot ever pass enemies.
// Also, the vanishing point curve transitions are suddenly jumping
// when env->speed is low. When env->speed is high, the curve 
// transitions are smooth, like they should be.
// Also, currently, enemy cars seem to wiggle with the road...
// 2. troubleshoot calling add_log() q step()
// 3. Compile warning for setup.py full compile (new)
// In file included from pufferlib/environments/ocean/puffer_enduro/cy_puffer_enduro.c:1272:
// pufferlib/environments/ocean/puffer_enduro/puffer_enduro.h:1747:29: note: expected ‘Client *’ but argument is of type ‘Enduro *’
//  1747 | Client* make_client(Client* client)

// 5. Add perf test
// 2. still doesn't avoid cars in middle lane. need to figure out why. goes really fast now, however.
// 2. Now (11/28/24) is able to successfully complete Day 1 from a model trained on 400 steps.
