// Solved issue with all of this block - some bad values for env->speed
// were occurring. Fixed, which fixed all of these issues as well.
// Separated rendering and environment logic; player car speed
// seems to somehow be locked to enemy car speed. That is, there is
// no difference in the speeds, so player cannot ever pass enemies.
// Also, the vanishing point curve transitions are suddenly jumping
// when env->speed is low. When env->speed is high, the curve 
// transitions are smooth, like they should be.
// Also, currently, enemy cars seem to wiggle with the road...
